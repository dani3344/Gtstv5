**Linux is a kernel.**
**Kernel** is a code/program that used to meet your Software and Hardware. And allocate some resources.

#### History of Linux
In 1969 a team led by computer scientists Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created the first version of UNIX on a PDP-7 minicomputer,  which was chosen mainly because of Thompson's familiarity with the system from his hobby work on it BUT IT WASN’T CHEAP AND OPEN-SOURCE. Then Person called “LINUS TORVALDS” Created the Linux kernel. And posted it online to make it open-source.
Richard Stallman announced the GNU project in 1983 and cofounded the Free Software Foundation in 1985.  GNU is a free software replacement to the UNIX OS, But it was just software replacement not full os {Examples: Bash,tar,emacs…} .  So GNU + LINUX will give the GNU/Linux OS.  The GNU Linux project was started to create a Unix-like operating system created with source code that could be copied, modified, and redistributed.

#### Shell
Users communicate with the kernel by the shell. ● The Shell is a Command Line Interpreter. It translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the Kernel

**Types of shells**
Based on their features there are money shells.
- SH 
- BASH 
- ZSH 
- FISH 
They differ in Coloring, Piping, command compilation, some kind of features. 
- TO IDENTIFY YOUR SHELL “`echo $SHELL`"

#### OS- Operating system
We have said **UNIX and GNU/Linux as OS** but what is OS. OS is “operating system”, which means the main software part of computer that helps to work on. It contains: 
- Kernel  
- Softwares
- Desktop environment 
- File extensions 
- Window manager e.g i3-window-manager
##### Desktop Environment
Types of desktop environment on linux
- Mate
- gnome
- KDE plasma
- XFCE
Which Desktop environment is best?
Speed depends on:  Animations, High Graphics, Quality
#### Why Linux?
- Fast :- No high spec computer/device needed
- Most used
- Most hacking tools
- Most Secured
#### Linux distributions/distro
Distro is Modified Linux Kernels,type of operating systems with different **Linux kernel, Packages(GNU), Package Manager and Desktop UI**.
##### So many distros
**Debian** 
- Kali linux 
- Ubuntu 
- Parrot 
**Arch** 
- Black arch 
- Garuda 
 **Fedora 
 Red Hat 
 Gentoo 
 Android**
##### Which is best for hackers? 
 - Kali linux 
 - Parrot Os 
 - Garuda 
 - Black Arch
**Kali Linux** is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. It is maintained and funded by Offensive Security.
- Desktop Env: xfce 
- Package manager: apt 
- Shell: zsh
**Parrot OS** is a Linux distribution based on Debian with a focus on security, privacy, and development.
- Desktop Env: mate 
- Package manager: apt 
- Shell: bash
**Garuda Linux** is a Linux distribution based on the Arch Linux operating system.
- Desktop Env: KDE plasma 
- Package Manager: pacman 
- Shell: fish

>Windows is not open-source so peoples won’t use or edit it, so there won’t be other kind. It just give updates and adds some feature on it.

##### How can we use it?
1. **Main OS/ Main-boot
2. **DualBoot / 2in1
3. **Live boot
4. **Cloud terminals
5. **Virtual Machine** :-Computers have a Technology called “VIRTUALIZATION”. This is the method how it allocate our using memory to the virtual machines/ VM’s. This is a method to use windows and linux together.  Softwares that gives you This ability: HyberV, QEMU, Virtual Box - Oracle, VMware...
6. **WSL v2 / Windows Subsystem for Linux** `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online - FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux`
7. **Termux - Android
